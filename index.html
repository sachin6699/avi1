          Figure 2: Here we have an example of a peadophile having a haircut
          from a rapist; it is a prime example of how molesting children can
          have severe impacts on your ability to assess the quality of a haircut
          given to you. Furthermore it is a prime example of why you should
          never let a rapist cut your hair!!!! :)
